It is heavily impacted by dredge mining for gold along the river that occurred during the first half of the last century. Large piles of gravel and reduced topsoil have left many open areas with only pockets of vegetation. The main attraction for birders over the years has been a Bank Swallow colony on the steep north bank of the river. The bare soil and patches of gravel are good sites to look for reptiles.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;On the drive into the park, you may see Wild Turkeys and black-tailed deer along the road. From the parking area, begin walking upstream on a service road. It is only a ten-minute walk to the traditional Bank Swallow colony. There are patches of vegetation that hold common species such as Anna&rsquo;s Hummingbird, Bewick&rsquo;s Wren and Spotted Towhee. A few large cottonwoods have managed to grow in the otherwise gravelly and hard soil, and they have been known to hold raptor nests. At the colony site, the river has cut steeply into the high bluffs and has created a sheer bank across the river from you. You can walk down the slope to a gravel bar opposite the colony. The nest holes are easily visible, but a scope is helpful to view the swallows as some of them sit with their heads peeking out of the holes. Both Bank Swallows and Northern Rough-winged Swallows use this site, and during some years the Bank Swallows, a threatened species in California, may be absent (they were last confirmed nesting here in 2002).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Following the service road and informal trails, there is a lot of habitat to explore, and you can continue upstream to the San Juan Rapids and beyond&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The entrance fee is currently $5 per vehicle or a $50 annual pass; see the Discovery Park narrative for the information about sites on the American River Parkway.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
