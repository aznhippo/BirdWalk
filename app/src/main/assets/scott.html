Oak Woodlands</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The following is one of five sections provide details on great birding areas from fall through spring. &nbsp;They can be combined into a full day of birding, or taken in sections as time allows. &nbsp;The main attraction for most birders is the chance to see winter raptors and Lewis&rsquo;s Woodpeckers in a relatively natural setting. &nbsp;It must be mentioned that the areas along Scott and White Rock Roads are under extreme development pressure, and the descriptions that follow are of the areas as they exist today. &nbsp;The Sacramento Valley Conservancy spearheaded a multi-partner effort to purchase 4,000 acres through which Latrobe Road travels&mdash;Deer Creek Hills. &nbsp;Determined efforts to preserve open space in the southeastern county are vital if we are to continue enjoying these wonderful birding areas.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Note</span><span class="c1">: &nbsp;Scott Road and White Rock Road are experiencing increasingly heavy traffic, so use caution and pull completely off of the road when parking.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Scott Road</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This area is primarily open grasslands interspersed with oaks. &nbsp;There are a few small creeks that normally dry up in the summer. &nbsp;Most of the area is fenced close to the road so parking can be difficult. &nbsp;Care must be taken not to impair traffic. &nbsp;The main use of the land is grazing. &nbsp;Climbing over the fences and walking on private land without the owner&rsquo;s permission is definitely not recommended. &nbsp;Landowners are very sensitive about trespassing. &nbsp;The area is of particular interest from the first fall rains until the water dries up (normally in July). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While traveling through the grasslands, watch the fences for Savannah, Vesper (rare) and Lark Sparrows, House Finches, Purple Finches (uncommon, winter), Western Meadowlarks, Northern Mockingbirds, Horned Larks, American Pipits, Western Bluebirds, Mountain Bluebirds (rare, winter), Western Kingbirds (spring, summer), Say&rsquo;s Phoebes (winter), Loggerhead Shrikes and American Kestrels.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the open country you should continuously scan rocks, posts, trees and the skies for birds of prey. &nbsp;Redtailed Hawks, Northern Harriers, American Kestrels, and Turkey Vultures are common. &nbsp;In winter, Merlins, American Kestrels, Roughlegged, Redshouldered, Sharpshinned, Cooper&rsquo;s and Ferruginous Hawks are occasionally seen, as are Golden and Bald Eagles. &nbsp;Prairie Falcons and White-tailed Kites are seen on most trips.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Watch for Black Phoebes near and under bridges (they often nest there). &nbsp;In any of the clusters of trees along the streams during spring and fall, watch for migrating warblers like Blackthroated Gray, Wilson&rsquo;s, Nashville, Orangecrowned, and Yellowrumped. &nbsp;You may also find Ruby-crowned Kinglets, Golden-crowned Kinglets (rare), Whitebreasted Nuthatches, Bushtits, Brown Creepers (rare), Bewick&rsquo;s Wrens and Oak Titmouse. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After turning onto Scott Road from White Rock Road, the first pond on the left is usually not very productive, but Belted Kingfishers, American Coots, Ringnecked Ducks and shorebirds are sometimes represented. &nbsp;Special finds during winter in this area are Lewis&rsquo; Woodpeckers and Phainopeplas. &nbsp;The trees along the entire route should be watched, but especially in the first 2.5 miles from White Rock Road. &nbsp;There are a few dirt pullouts, and a large paved pullout 2.0 miles from White Rock Road. &nbsp;The area by the first bridge should also be watched for Rock Wrens, California and Spotted Towhees. Acorn Woodpeckers are generally common along the entire route, but Nuttall&rsquo;s and Downy woodpeckers are also often seen. &nbsp;The marsh on the left, 2.4 miles from White Rock Road, used to have nesting Yellowheaded Blackbirds in the cattails. &nbsp;Although they have not been seen recently, keep looking. &nbsp;When there is open water there, you may find American Coots and ducks.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second large bridge, Carson Creek, is usually excellent when there is a lot of water in the stream. &nbsp;Great Egrets, Great Blue Herons, Greater Yellowlegs, Killdeer and Wilson&rsquo;s Snipe are seen often. &nbsp;Many spring migrants might be seen: &nbsp;Lazuli Buntings, Cassin&rsquo;s and Warbling Vireos, Western Tanagers, Wilson&rsquo;s, Yellow, MacGillivray&rsquo;s and Nashville Warblers.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 5.5 miles, Scott Road crosses Deer Creek. &nbsp;In high water, the stream flows over the road. &nbsp;This area usually has Tree Swallows in spring and summer, and is sometimes very productive in migration. &nbsp;Watch for traffic.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c3">Bruce Swinehart</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span></span></p></body></html>
