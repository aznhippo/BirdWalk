In spring, nesting Lesser Nighthawks are present in the Buttes Sink area. Flocks of Sandhill Cranes and Tundra Swans are more likely here than in the refuge in winter. &nbsp;Uncommon to rare birds such as Vesper Sparrow, Mountain Bluebird, Sage Thrasher and Lark Bunting have been found. &nbsp;For maximum enjoyment, a spotting scope is a must. &nbsp;You may wish to bring a camera to record highlights, although a telephoto lens is a must for most bird pictures. &nbsp;A picnic lunch is recommended. &nbsp;During the winter, dress for cold, wet, and foggy weather.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">There is currently a $2.50 per person entrance fee.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ed Greaves</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p></body></html>
