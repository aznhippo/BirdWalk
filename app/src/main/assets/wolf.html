class="c2 c4">Wolf Ranch Wildlife Sanctuary</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Wolf Ranch, formally open pasture in Rio Linda, was purchased by the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (SAFCA), and used as a borrow pit and source of fill for the North Area Local Project Levee improvements. &nbsp;Approximately 800,000 cubic yards of soil were excavated allowing for the creation of a 60-acre wetland complex with five habitat types ranging from open water and wetlands to upland forests. &nbsp;In 1997, SAFCA planted the site with wetland plants, native riparian shrubs and trees. &nbsp;As Wolf Ranch has continued to mature into a sustainable wetland and wooded upland, SAFCA biologists have seen a significant increase in bird species and diversity, increasing from 58 species in 2001, to 96 species in 2004.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">From the parking lot, walk around the gate to Sorento Road and head south. &nbsp;Granite Construction Company and a very large commercial parking area will be on your left, behind a cyclone fence. &nbsp;On your right, Steelhead Creek parallels Sorento Road. &nbsp;Check the creek for Great Egret, Great Blue Heron, Snowy Egret, Greater Yellowlegs, Common Snipe, and other wading birds and shorebirds. &nbsp;In winter, Savannah Sparrows are fairly common.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">At about one-half mile south on Sorento Road, you will see another gate, a portable restroom, and the wetland restoration area. &nbsp;Follow the wide dirt path around the wetland in either direction&mdash;the total distance is about 1.5 miles on flat terrain. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Walking in a clockwise direction, you will eventually come to a drainage ditch along a railroad track. &nbsp;A careful inspection of this area may yield an American Bittern or other wading bird species. &nbsp;Continuing the loop around the wetlands there are many opportunities for viewing open water and a variety of birds. &nbsp;In the winter look for Double-crested Cormorant, Canvasback, Northern Shoveler, Cinnamon Teal, and other waterfowl. &nbsp;Also keep an eye on the telephone poles and fence posts for Red-tailed Hawks, American Kestrels, and Loggerhead Shrikes. &nbsp;If you look closely in the trees and shrubs, you may also see warblers, kinglets, hummingbirds, and perhaps a Downy Woodpecker or two. &nbsp;Great-tailed Grackles are a possibility here in spring and summer.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Walking past the south end of the wetland you will eventually see the continuation of Steelhead Creek on your left, heading toward Sorento Road and the parking area. &nbsp;The road on the south side of the site is flooded during the winter. &nbsp;The best birding is in winter and spring.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brian Gilmore</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span
