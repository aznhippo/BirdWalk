class="c4"><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Rayhouse Road</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Blue Ridge area of Yolo County is a rugged mix of steep mountains, oak woodlands, patches of riparian, outstanding vistas, and a sea of chaparral. &nbsp;Early mornings in the spring are best, with opportunities for Common Poorwill and bobcats in the road in the predawn, as well as Mountain Quail (calling&mdash;hard to see), California Thrasher, Sage Sparrow, and Lawrence&rsquo;s Goldfinch. &nbsp;The lower, more heavily forested portions of the road have produced numerous records of Pileated Woodpeckers. &nbsp;Band-tailed Pigeons have also been found here.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The road is usually open from late April through October, but the dates vary from year to year depending on the weather. &nbsp;It is steep and rocky in places, but is not a four-wheel-drive road&mdash;a vehicle with moderate clearance can make the trip. &nbsp;When the road is closed, portions of it can be walked with good results. &nbsp;There are many miles of roads and trails to explore, but walking just the first mile can be productive.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As with the rest of life, you can&rsquo;t be everywhere at once. &nbsp;If your targets are the chaparral birds, then heading quickly through the lower sections of road is probably your best bet. &nbsp;Early mornings are best for singing birds everywhere, but this is especially so with California Thrashers, Sage Sparrows, and Black-chinned Sparrows (very rare). &nbsp;Once the wind picks up or it gets warm, your chances of finding many of these birds drop precipitously. &nbsp;The expanse of the area and all that it has to offer will probably draw you back for multiple trips. &nbsp;Exploring the oak woodlands and riparian habitat also has its rewards.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The low water bridge (not passable when the creek is running high) on Cache Creek often has Cliff Swallow nests, allowing for close views. &nbsp;American Dippers have been found here on rare occasions. &nbsp;Canyon Wrens can be found in the lower section of Rayhouse Road&mdash;most often from Cache Creek up a short distance to the barn on the right side of the road.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After crossing the low water bridge and climbing out of the creek channel, there is a gated road on your left and signs to the Blue Ridge Trail. &nbsp;You can park here and walk to the trailhead. &nbsp;There is nice woodland habitat to explore. &nbsp;The trail itself is extremely steep (a 2,100-foot climb in four miles, and most of the climb in just two miles!), but even a short excursion is worthwhile, and it doesn&rsquo;t get really steep immediately. &nbsp;Details are at the Yolo Hiker Web site (yolohiker.org).</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back to Rayhouse Road: &nbsp;After passing some riparian habitat and oak woodland, the road climbs rather steeply. &nbsp;It is oak woodland for the first 3.3 miles from Highway 16, then it transitions to chaparral. &nbsp;The woodlands can be alive with migrants in season and have produced many Pileated Woodpecker reports. &nbsp;As you stop along the road, you may hear the &ldquo;quark&rdquo; of Mountain Quail, but you will be lucky to see one. &nbsp;When you reach the chaparral, look and listen for Blue-gray Gnatcatchers, California Thrashers, and Sage Sparrows. &nbsp;If you are very lucky, you might hear a Black-chinned Sparrow. &nbsp;Lazuli Buntings can be numerous. &nbsp;At 4.8 miles from Highway 16, turn left for 0.6 mile to Fiske Lake. &nbsp;This has been the most regular site for Lawrence&rsquo;s Goldfinches. &nbsp;Back to Rayhouse Road, and another three miles will take you to Davis Creek Reservoir, where Bald Eagles have nested.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You will see a sign for the lower site of the Cache Creek Canyon Regional Park. &nbsp;Take Road 40/Rayhouse Road down the hill to the creek. &nbsp;The low water bridge is only passable when flows in Cache Creek are moderate. &nbsp;If the gate is closed but it is safe to walk across the bridge, there are many miles of roads and trails to explore on foot. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Road information is available at the Yolo
