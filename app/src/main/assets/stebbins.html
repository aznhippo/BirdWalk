Stebbins Reserve </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve is a beautiful birding area which draws some bird species unique to the Sacramento checklist area. &nbsp;The canyon itself is densely vegetated, and the predominant species are typical of riparian oak and scrub woodland including interior, live and blue oaks, buckeyes, chamise, cottonwoods, coyote brush, manzanita and toyons. &nbsp;The canyon is a wonderland of wildflowers in April and May. &nbsp;Near the top is a blend zone of coastal and valley vegetation. &nbsp;The reserve is owned and managed by the University of California at Davis as a research area and is currently open to the public from sunrise to sunset. &nbsp;Visitors are asked to stay on the trails; abuse could cause closure&mdash;as an incentive to stay on the trail, deer ticks and poison oak are common, as are Pacific rattlesnakes, especially near the Homestead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c3">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As you approach the mountains on Highway 128, check the skies above for hawks and possibly a Golden Eagle, and the fields and fences for Western Bluebirds. &nbsp;In spring, the fields are covered with flowers, mainly lupine and California poppies. &nbsp;The valley oaks here are always a treat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As you begin your hike, continue straight ahead approximately 100 yards to the entry of the Stebbins Preserve. &nbsp;There is a large kiosk and map of the area as well as trail guides and a place to sign in. &nbsp;Be sure to sign in and out and follow all the posted rules. &nbsp;The trail parallels and soon crosses Cold Creek. &nbsp;The creek is not perennial so the only time you may have trouble crossing is in the spring when water is rushing toward Putah Creek. &nbsp;Continue up canyon through rather dense vegetation, and the trail will open to a grassy clearing with wonderful views of the coastal mountains on both sides. &nbsp;Just past the clearing is a densely shaded area called the Homestead where remnants of an early dwelling can be found. &nbsp;The trail for our purposes ends in these trees. &nbsp;Above this is private property. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Any season can be rewarding. &nbsp;The best time to visit is early in the morning as even in the spring and fall, this canyon can be hot. &nbsp;The trail is moderately steep and rocky in many places and may not be suitable for some birders with disabilities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Resident species include Cooper&#39;s and Red-tailed Hawks, Golden Eagles, Mountain Quail, Western Screech-Owls, Great Horned Owls, Northern Pygmy-Owls, White-throated Swifts, Anna&#39;s Hummingbirds, Nuttall&#39;s Woodpeckers, Black Phoebes, Western Scrub-Jay and Steller&rsquo;s Jays, Oak Titmice, Bushtits, Bewick&#39;s Wrens, Rock and &nbsp;Canyon Wrens (near the creek), Blue-gray Gnatcatchers, Wrentits (their ping pong call often heard), California Thrashers (usually singing), Hutton&rsquo;s Vireo, California and Spotted Towhees, Rufous-crowned and Sage Sparrows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In summer, expect Black-headed Grosbeaks, Lazuli Buntings, Common Poorwills (before daybreak), Bullock&#39;s Orioles and several species of swallows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In winter, expect Sharp-shinned Hawks, Varied Thrushes, and crowned sparrows. &nbsp;Long-eared Owls and Northern Saw-whet Owls have been recorded. &nbsp;Spring is one of the best times, and you can expect flycatchers, hummingbirds, warblers, vireos and Western Tanagers along with the year-round residents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whether or not you hike up the canyon, a great place for a picnic lunch is below the dam. &nbsp;After crossing Putah Creek on Highway 128 coming from the east, drive into the lower parking lot and walk toward Putah Creek. &nbsp;This is a good spot to listen for Canyon Wrens across the creek and for occasional Rock Wrens. &nbsp;Rufous-crowned Sparrows have been found in this location.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Also keep your eyes open for a Northern Pygmy-Owl which frequents the south side of the creek close to the dam. &nbsp;A great time to see this bird is in the winter when the leaves are off the trees. &nbsp;Once a Pygmy-Owl entertained a group from Sacramento Audubon sitting only 20 feet from us on an open branch, ignoring us, then plunging into the grass below and coming up with a mouse! &nbsp;The mouse was almost as big as the owl!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An American Dipper may be found sporadically in winter on Putah Creek from the dam to downstream of the Highway 128 bridge&mdash;often just below the bridge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As you leave the parking area, drive around the curve west on Highway 128 to the top of the dam for a view of Lake Berryessa. Watch for Western and Clark&#39;s Grebes on the lake and look overhead for White-throated Swifts, Turkey Vultures, hawks and a possible Golden Eagle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c4">June C.
