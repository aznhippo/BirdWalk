Cottontails, jackrabbits, and black-tailed deer are often flushed as you slowly work through the area. &nbsp;If you sit quietly for sustained periods, you may be rewarded with glimpses of California meadow voles and even a coyote. &nbsp;Bobcats have been found in the chamise chaparral not far to the north, which can be reached by following the Pioneer Express Trail that runs above the open grassy area on the far side of the bight. &nbsp;A map available at the park entrance shows this and other trails. &nbsp;This same chaparral is excellent habitat for California Thrasher and Wrentit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c5">Tim Fitzer</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p></body></html>
