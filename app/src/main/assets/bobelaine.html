The Sanctuary contains a variety of habitats, including riverbank willows, shrubby thickets, grasslands and climax oak woodland. &nbsp;Bobelaine Sanctuary is owned by the National Audubon Society, and for many years it was solely managed, funded and operated by the Sacramento Audubon Chapter. &nbsp;While Sacramento Audubon is still actively involved with Bobelaine, it is no longer financially responsible for the support of the sanctuary. &nbsp;National Audubon has received a bequest, which will be invested, and the dividends will provide for Bobelaine&#39;s expenses and management.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Magnificent mature California sycamores and massive valley oaks are the predominant trees in the sanctuary. &nbsp;A 1992 fire destroyed 90% of the mature Fremont cottonwoods in the sanctuary. &nbsp;Three restoration projects have successfully replaced several hundred cottonwoods, some of which are now thirty to forty feet tall. &nbsp;In winter, coyote bush will be blooming; in summer the wild rose, moth mullen, evening primrose and blackberries may be seen. &nbsp;In the fall, California wild grape will be ripe and poison oak will show its brilliant fall colors. &nbsp;Watch out for poison oak, which flourishes year-round. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bobelaine is open to the public to walk through during daylight hours. &nbsp;The sanctuary is not wheelchair accessible. &nbsp;No pets, bikes, fires, hunting, horseback riding or fishing are allowed. &nbsp;Please stay on the trails and help protect this beautiful habitat by observing the no smoking policy in the sanctuary, picnic areas and parking lot. &nbsp;A chemical toilet, picnic tables, and running water are available at the parking area. &nbsp;The sanctuary is about 2.5 miles long and about a half-mile wide (between the levee and the Feather River). &nbsp;There are about five miles of trails to explore, and there are usually trail maps in the mailbox at the parking area. &nbsp;A self-guided trail brochure is available for sale at the Sacramento Audubon Society general meetings, on the Web site (</span><span class="c0 c4"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://sacramentoaudubon.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1459738088700000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEbFRsIj0cYxJXN-BRfZuLx6P9EPw">sacramentoaudubon.org</a></span><span class="c0">) and at several bird and nature stores in the region.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A walk through the sanctuary is a delight in any season. &nbsp;Over 190 species of birds have been recorded. &nbsp;Beaver, otter, and deer are often seen. &nbsp;In summer, Swainson&rsquo;s Hawks soar overhead, and the secretive Yellow-billed Cuckoo has been spotted during its short summer nesting season (though not since the 1990s). &nbsp;There is a nesting colony of Bank Swallows on the east side of the Feather River, visible downstream from the River Overlook. &nbsp;Great Horned Owls are common here. &nbsp;Wood Ducks, herons, egrets, turtles and Pied-billed Grebes can be found year-round on Lake Crandall and the adjacent sloughs. &nbsp;Springtime brings a variety of warblers and other migrants as well as nesting Western Bluebirds, Bullock&rsquo;s Orioles and Black-headed Grosbeaks. &nbsp;In winter, sparrows, towhees, kinglets, Yellow-rumped Warblers and Northern Flickers are among the common birds.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A short walk (2.2 miles round trip) will take you north on the levee past Lake Crandall, into the sanctuary at the main entrance past Wood Duck Slough, up the Center Trail to Eizinger Grove, on the North Trail to the River Overlook, back to the north trail, west to the Otter Trail, south to the Center trail, then back to the parking lot. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c3">Bill Clark</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span></span></p></body></html>
