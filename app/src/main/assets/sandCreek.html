in the road at 6.5 miles, where the main road goes left. &nbsp;There is another &ldquo;Y&rdquo; at 10.3 miles, and the main road goes right. &nbsp;Both of these side roads can be explored, though they end at gates after a short distance. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In summer and fall, the remnant water in the creek beds can attract Lawrence&rsquo;s Goldfinches and other species to drink and bathe (learning the Lawrence&rsquo;s high &ldquo;tee-too&rdquo; flight call helps with detection). &nbsp;The best site has been at mile 9.9, where the road crosses a small creek. &nbsp;Many other species have been seen here, including thrashers, Sage Sparrows, and Purple Finches.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After passing the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; at mile 10.3, the road climbs through dense chaparral. &nbsp;This and any areas of chamise and other chaparral should be checked for California Thrashers and Sage Sparrows. &nbsp;Knowing their songs is very helpful, though they are both often seen in spring. &nbsp;Mountain Quail can often be heard and occasionally seen in this area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">At mile 11, where the road tops out, there is a short road on the left to a convenient parking area. &nbsp;From here you will have outstanding views in all directions. &nbsp;If your primary targets are the chaparral species, you will want to arrive here early in the morning. &nbsp;This area is your best bet for Black-chinned Sparrow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">If the gate is open and the road is passable, you can continue into Yolo County, where it is only four miles to Highway 16 at Rumsey. &nbsp;Some of the densest oak woodlands on the route are here, and Hairy Woodpeckers (uncommon) can be found. &nbsp;In 2.7 miles you will reach pavement. &nbsp;A gate here is closed in winter, but allows for walking access. &nbsp;Bobcats have been seen on several occasions between the county line and Highway 16. &nbsp;You will cross Cache Creek just before reaching Highway 16. &nbsp;The riparian vegetation is worth checking, but beware of traffic and don&rsquo;t park on the bridge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">With an early start, it is possible to spend a half day on Sand Creek Road and not see another vehicle.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2">Chris Conard and Kimya Lambert</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p></body></html>
