class="c5"><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c4">Yolo Wildlife Area (also known as the Vic Fazio Wildlife Area)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This Globally Important Wildlife Area now contains more than 25,000 acres, and is just minutes from downtown Sacramento. &nbsp;Both seasonal and permanent wetlands are present as well as riparian woodland and valley grassland, providing habitat for a large variety of birds. &nbsp;Seasonal flooding provides key habitat for countless waterfowl migrating along the Pacific Flyway, one of four major migratory routes in the United States. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The wildlife area is open to the public when the bypass is not flooded. &nbsp;General hours are sunrise to sunset, with the wildlife area closed on Christmas Day. &nbsp;The entrance gate may be closed on holidays if staff are unavailable. &nbsp;During hunting season (September-February), auto and pedestrian access is limited to the auto loop. &nbsp;Additional areas are open to autos and pedestrians the rest of the year. &nbsp;You may park along the gravel roads as well as designated parking areas. &nbsp;A number of foot trails are available from various parking lots. &nbsp;The headquarters, which features exhibits of local birds, is located on Chiles Road (parallel to and south of Interstate 80) west of the entrance to the wildlife area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c4">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Shorebirds and waterfowl are often present in large numbers from fall through spring, depending on water levels. &nbsp;Occasional Tricolored Blackbirds and Yellow-headed Blackbirds are seen from spring through fall. &nbsp;Raptors abound, including nesting Swainson&rsquo;s Hawks and Northern Harriers. &nbsp;American Bitterns, Soras, and Virginia Rails can sometimes be found. &nbsp;River otters are present in the canals and ponds year-round.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cinnamon Teal are common, and Ruddy Ducks and Gadwalls are present year-round. &nbsp;Green-winged Teal and occasional Blue-winged Teal can be found except during mid-summer months. &nbsp;When the bypass is flooded, diving ducks can be present in large numbers. &nbsp;At times, thousands of Canvasbacks, Ring-necked Ducks, and Lesser Scaup can be seen (when the causeway is flooded, these birds can be scoped from the levee at the entrance gate). &nbsp;This is the most reliable site in the Sacramento area to find Greater Scaup. &nbsp;American White Pelicans utilize the deeper ponds for feeding. &nbsp;Large flocks of Greater Yellowlegs often contain Lesser Yellowlegs. &nbsp;These and large dowitcher flocks may contain an occasional Ruff, and shorebird concentrations can attract a Peregrine Falcon or Merlin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In summer, southern migration results in large numbers of swallows, including Tree, Cliff, Barn and occasional Bank. &nbsp;Horned Larks breed in the wildlife area and Savannah Sparrows are recently discovered breeders. &nbsp;Common Yellowthroats and Marsh Wrens are numerous. &nbsp;White-faced Ibis, occasionally numbering in the thousands, may be found flying into and over the area to roost at night and to feed in the surrounding fields during the day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For information, call
