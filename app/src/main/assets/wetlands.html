Clark&rsquo;s Grebes, Western Grebes, Eared Grebes, American Avocets, Black-necked Stilts, diving ducks and occasional Redheads are also found in this lagoon. &nbsp;Cinnamon Teal occur in large numbers, and Ruddy Ducks and Gadwalls are present year round. &nbsp;Green-winged and occasional Blue-winged Teal can be found except during mid-summer months.</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Numbers and intensity of birds on Stormwater Lagoon varies depending on the amount of water present. &nbsp;As this rainwater evaporates in the summer months, large numbers of migrating shorebirds such as Long-billed Dowitchers and both Greater and Lesser Yellowlegs can be found. &nbsp;Peregrine Falcons may be attracted by the shorebird activity. In winter, waterfowl abound.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On leaving the Wastewater Treatment Plant or the Davis Wetlands, checking the ditch and fence along Road 28H may produce Burrowing Owls; also check the ponds north of the road which may harbor large numbers of ducks and shorebirds.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Stop at the access gate and sign in at the kiosk to the left of the gate. &nbsp;The gate is kept closed by a bungee cord; be sure to close this behind you and sign out when you leave. &nbsp;Hours are 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. daily from February 15 to August 31. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c3">Currently, from September 1 to February 14, during the hunting season, the wetlands are open only on Mondays (7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.). </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vehicles must remain on the tour loop, but pedestrians are welcome to walk the other roads in the wetlands. &nbsp;Tours are generally offered by the Yolo Basin Foundation on the first Saturday of the month (yolobasin.org). &nbsp;For updated access information to the wetlands, check the City of Davis Web site (city.davis.ca.us/pw/water/wetlands.cfm).</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c1">Maureen Geiger and Joan Humphrey</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p></body></html>
