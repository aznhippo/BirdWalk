A special dam removes the debris (tree limbs and trash) from the water before it is pumped into the river. It&rsquo;s not much of a lake anymore; a better title might be Bushy Marsh. It started out as a borrow pit for a golf course that was never completed during the mid-1960s. If you look closely at the adjoining floodplain, you can see some elevated areas where the earth diggings were dumped. For many years, it was a good fishing lake, and there were many trails all along the lake. Currently, thick aquatic vegetation clogs the lake and the remaining fish are hard to find. This large area from the river to the levee and Interstate 80 back toward the R.V. park is about 400 acres. In addition to all of the birds, it harbors a great deal of wildlife such as deer, coyotes, beaver and otters. Sometimes R.V.-ers will have bird feeders that are worth checking.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">Birding the Site:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Birding can be good whether wet or dry. The best way to bird the lake is from the levee, where stretches of water can be seen through the trees.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the Cal Expo R.V. Park on your right, walk west on the bike trail or the narrow road which leads up onto the levee; a large stream overflow basin will be on your left. Walk west on this levee heading toward the white Cal Expo tower. The lake is about half a mile from the starting point on the levee which runs along the south border of Cal Expo. Although there are a few trails closer to the lake and at its level, they have mainly been created by the homeless people who sometimes use the area. In addition, the vegetation along the lake is so thick, it is nearly impossible to see through. The best viewing is from the levee. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Birding this area can be especially good in the spring and fall because the riparian habitat around the lake, especially willows and cottonwoods, attracts many migrating warblers, vireos, flycatchers, etc., and from the levee, you are looking down on the area. The lake is good year-round for Great Egrets, Great Blue Herons, Wood Ducks, Mallards and Common Moorhens. Red-tailed Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks and Great Horned Owls frequently nest in the area. The lake runs almost all the way to the Interstate 80 bridge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is also a slough that runs between the lake and the levee maintained by a beaver dam for the final quarter-mile before the bridge across Interstate 80. At the bridge, you can either retrace your steps, or walk down from the levee and follow the homeless trail along the freeway fence and across the floodplain toward the river and the American River Bike Trail. Any of the fire roads that cross the floodplain, the bike path, or the horse trail near the river will take you back to the parking lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This large area from the river to the levee and Interstate 80 back toward the R.V. park is about 400 acres.
