Ancil Hoffman Park and the nature center are part of the annual American River Natural History Association (ARNHA) December Wildlife Count, and the Bird and Breakfast event in March. Typically 50-55 bird species are seen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The site includes oak woodlands, grasslands, a pond and access to the river. Marked trails make exploring easy and accessible. The nature center is open every day except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s Day. Summer hours, March 1 to October 31, are 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Winter hours, November 1 through February, are 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. It offers exhibits and information about the river and its wildlife, besides the practical advantages of rest rooms and drinking fountains. A multi-purpose assembly building has recently been added to support the nature center&rsquo;s program and storage needs. If you visit when the center is open, you may wish to pick up a map to the trails. Please remember to stay on the trails. You may also purchase field guides and checklists at the reception counter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c2">Birding the site</span><span class="c1">:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Because this birding spot is easy to reach and includes a variety of habitats, it is possible to sight more than 100 species during the course of a year. In the spring, migrating warblers move through the woods. The crowned sparrows return each fall, and winter brings the goldeneyes back to the river. A Merlin sometimes takes up winter residence on an old snag near the northeast end of the service road.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Some of the notable permanent species are the Wild Turkeys that feed in the grasslands, the Acorn Woodpeckers that take advantage of dead trees for acorn storage and nesting holes, and the Red-shouldered Hawks and Great Horned Owls that nest along with the Yellow-billed Magpies in the tall oaks and cottonwoods of the woodlands. Frequently you will find White-tailed Kites hunting rodents in the grasslands. Approaching the pond you may find a Green Heron stalking fish in the shallows, hear the rattle of a Belted Kingfisher or see a pair of Wood Ducks or Mallards floating under the hanging vegetation at the pond&rsquo;s edge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Western Scrub-Jays are a common sight, and a careful look in the oaks will often produce a flock of Bushtits, pairs of Oak Titmouse, Nuttall&rsquo;s Woodpecker, White-breasted Nuthatch, and in winter, Ruby-crowned Kinglet. The blackberry thickets at the side of the road and along the paths shelter California Quail, Bewick&rsquo;s Wren, and Spotted and California Towhees. The star thistle patches attract both American Goldfinches and Lesser Goldfinches. Black Phoebes like the ponds. Anna&rsquo;s Hummingbirds frequent the California fuchsia planted near the parking lot and nature center building. Western Bluebirds and Tree Swallows have nested in the snags at the edge of the meadow and have taken advantage of nesting boxes placed in the area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Along the river&rsquo;s edge, you may find Killdeer, Greater Yellowlegs, Spotted Sandpiper and the magnificent Great Blue Heron and Great Egret. When the salmon are spawning in the late fall, American Crows and Turkey Vultures gather along with a variety of gulls to scavenge the dead fish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">In addition to the many species of birds you may spot, you may also find deer, western gray squirrels, California ground squirrels, and see evidence of the many other mammals that live in the nature area such as striped skunks, gray foxes, coyotes, opossums, raccoons, cottontails and jackrabbits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The Effie Yeaw Nature Center and the surrounding area are truly rich in wildlife and are great places to introduce young and old to the natural world. Visit often.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c4">Jo Smith; updated by Brian Gilmore</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The entrance fee is currently $5 per vehicle or a $50 annual pass; see the Discovery Park narrative for the information about sites on the American River Parkway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
