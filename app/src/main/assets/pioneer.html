Strollers are not recommended.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The habitat is principally oak woodlands and chaparral with some streamside woodlands and one pond. &nbsp;Interior live oak, valley oak, scrub oak, blue and black oak, gray pine, white alder and Fremont cottonwood are some of the trees that will be encountered along the trail. &nbsp;Among the shrubs will be toyon, California wild grape, blackberry, star thistle, and many varieties of ceanothus and manzanita. &nbsp;The poison oak can grow quite robust, and may overhang some areas of the trail after a particularly wet spring.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Birding the site (winter)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">An afternoon hike in this area on a clear day in the middle of January will reward the birdwatcher with sunshine, green foothill grasses, early blooming manzanita and coyote bush, and over 60 common species of birds. &nbsp;This is also the best time of year for sighting Bald Eagles and Osprey soaring along the lake&rsquo;s shoreline.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Species easily seen at the edges of the oak woodland in winter include California Quail, Anna&rsquo;s Hummingbird, Northern Flicker, Acorn, Downy and Nuttall&rsquo;s Woodpeckers, Black Phoebe, Yellow-billed Magpie, Oak Titmouse, Bushtit, Bewick&rsquo;s Wren, Hermit Thrush, Western Bluebird, Ruby-crowned Kinglet, Yellow-rumped Warbler, Spotted and California Towhees, Lark Sparrow and crowned sparrows.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Harder to find but still present are Cooper&rsquo;s and Sharp-shinned hawks, Wild Turkey, Band-tailed Pigeon, Red-breasted Sapsucker, Wrentit, Phainopepla, Hutton&rsquo;s Vireo and Purple Finch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The boat ramp is a good place to scan the lake for Common Loon, Canada Geese, Horned, Eared, Western and Clark&rsquo;s Grebes, Common Goldeneye, Ruddy Duck, Lesser Scaup, Common Merganser and several types of gulls. &nbsp;Also check the water&rsquo;s edge for Spotted Sandpipers and Greater Yellowlegs. &nbsp;The granite outcrops between the water&rsquo;s edge and the high water line are reliable areas to find Rock Wrens. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Birding the site (spring and summer)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;The most distinct calls heard in spring are the Ash-throated Flycatchers and Bewick&rsquo;s and House Wrens. The best place for Rufous-crowned sparrows is just after passing mile marker 47 at the bottom of the hill, as nesting activity was recently observed here. &nbsp;Just before Avery Pond is a man-made rock trough filled with water from a natural spring. &nbsp;A small footbridge crosses over the dampest area. &nbsp;The abundant blackberry bushes and wild irises announce the closeness of Avery pond. &nbsp;This is often the best spot for hummingbirds and warblers catching mosquitoes.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">At Avery Pond almost anything is possible, especially during spring migration. &nbsp;Check the willows and cottonwoods carefully. &nbsp;Birds found in the spring and summer include Belted Kingfisher, Green Heron, Wood Ducks, Black-chinned Hummingbird, Western Wood Peewee, Pacific-slope Flycatcher, Western Kingbird, Black Phoebe, Common Yellowthroat, Orange-crowned and Wilson&rsquo;s Warblers. &nbsp;Other animal species seen around the pond include bullfrogs, turtles, deer, dragonflies and damselflies.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Continue around Avery Pond and north another 0.2 miles to the Newcastle Power House structure to see the best display of swallows, soaring Turkey Vultures and hawks. &nbsp;On the other side of the Power House is another footbridge, which crosses Mormon&rsquo;s Ravine. &nbsp;Many locals also call this the &ldquo;Whitewater Bridge,&rdquo; as high water releases can occur here. &nbsp;After this bridge, the trail continues another 8 miles to Auburn. &nbsp;The trail becomes drier, rockier, and much less wooded, causing a decrease in the variety of bird species and numbers. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">For photographers and those who enjoy wild flowers, April is the best month to see the finest display of wildflowers. &nbsp;Most numerous are the many types of purple vetch and lupine, and the orange bush monkey flower. &nbsp;There is also a kaleidoscope of color from brodiaea, paintbrush, milkweed, gilia, Indian pink, buttercup, iris, globe and mariposa lilies, and violets. &nbsp;The hill around the Newcastle Power House also has an impressive display of purple Chinese houses.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">If you can time your outing to return at dusk, you may also enjoy some of the nocturnal species of the foothills. &nbsp;Listen and look for Western Screech-Owls, Northern Pygmy-Owls and Great Horned Owls, as well as bats. &nbsp;In years past, Common Poorwills were observed from April through October, but there have been no reports in recent years. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c5">Natalie Fenner</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p></body></html>
