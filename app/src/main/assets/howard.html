class="c4"><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Howard Ranch Trail</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Rancho Seco Recreational Area consists of a reservoir lined with riparian vegetation and a campground and day use area with planted trees and lawn. &nbsp;The surrounding habitat is open grassland, so it has the potential to serve as a migrant trap. &nbsp;It also provides the only public access to the Howard Ranch&mdash;a 12,000-acre preserve of grasslands, vernal pools, and oak woodlands. &nbsp;It is a working cattle ranch that was purchased by the Nature Conservancy in 1999 as part of the Cosumnes River Preserve Project and sold to a rancher with a conservation easement precluding development. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rancho Seco is 30 minutes southeast of downtown Sacramento. &nbsp;It is owned by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and is just east of the closed nuclear facility. &nbsp;The park is open year-round from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. &nbsp;The entrance gate is locked every night. &nbsp;For more information, check SMUD&rsquo;s Web site (smud.org/about/recreation-rancho.html).</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the entrance kiosk, where a Sage Thrasher was found in October 2004, continue to the reservoir. &nbsp;Just before reaching the dam, there is a large parking area on the left where you can scan the lake for waterbirds. &nbsp;It is best on weekday mornings before crowds of people have flushed the birds. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the Howard Ranch trail, go left before crossing the dam, and continue down the dirt track to the parking area at the trailhead (you might consider parking nearer the main road so that your vehicle is visible and less likely to be broken into). &nbsp;The trail is a seven-mile loop. &nbsp;The first portion goes along the lakeshore, providing views of the lake and access to the riparian vegetation, where sparrows and other songbirds may be found. &nbsp;Much of the trail goes through open grassland, so bird diversity is low. &nbsp;Ferruginous Hawks and other winter raptors may be present. &nbsp;Burrowing Owls have been found beneath the bridges. &nbsp;In early spring, there is a wonderful wildflower show, and Horned Larks and Western Meadowlarks are in full song&mdash;in spring Western Meadowlarks perform flight songs with extra flourishes to their already spectacular song. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the trail does not reach east into the oak woodlands, but it is good to know that this habitat has been protected from development. &nbsp;Be sure to close any gates you have to open on the trail, since cattle are grazing there from fall through spring. &nbsp;In the warmer months, beware that wasps are sometimes living in the gates.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To reach the campground and day use area, drive across the dam. &nbsp;You might notice several oryx on your right at the animal sanctuary. &nbsp;Continuing toward the campground, check the rolling grasslands for raptors and the fences for sparrows. &nbsp;The trees around the campground may harbor interesting migrants or wintering birds. &nbsp;In the evenings in summer you may see Lesser Nighthawks foraging over the lake.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span
