Bird groups such as waterfowl, divers, shorebirds, terns and rails are not to be expected in any kind of numbers either as residents or migrants. &nbsp;However, there are enough marginal wetlands present so that with the rich riparian woodland present, one can almost expect any bird found within the Central Valley at the proper season.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The mature trees and lawn area at the park entrance and along Laurel Avenue attract a wide variety of birds all year long. &nbsp;Residents include Mourning Dove, Anna&rsquo;s Hummingbird (check the feeders along Laurel Avenue), Nuttall&rsquo;s and Downy Woodpeckers; Black Phoebe, Western Scrub Jay, Oak Titmouse, Bushtit, White-breasted Nuthatch, Brewer&rsquo;s Blackbird, House Finch, and both Lesser and American Goldfinches. &nbsp;During both periods of migration, nearly every species of warbler can be found, including Orange-crowned, Nashville, Yellow, Black-throated Gray, Townsend&rsquo;s, Hermit, and Wilson&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Other migrants to be expected include Warbling Vireo, Western Tanager, and Black-headed Grosbeak. &nbsp;Spring arrivals that stay to nest in this area include Black-chinned Hummingbird; Barn, Northern Rough-winged, and Tree Swallows, Ash-throated Flycatcher, and Bullock&rsquo;s Oriole. &nbsp;Birds that arrive in fall that spend the winter include Red-breasted Nuthatch (rare), Cedar Waxwing, Ruby-crowned Kinglet, Yellow-rumped Warbler, and both White-crowned and Golden-crowned Sparrows.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the lake is drawn down from October to March, the diversity can be quite high, especially in late fall and early winter. &nbsp;One can expect American White Pelican (rare), Double-crested Cormorant, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, Snowy Egret, Green-winged Teal, Common Merganser, Killdeer, Black-necked Stilt, Greater Yellowlegs, Least Sandpiper, Dunlin, Long-billed Dowitcher, and California and Ring-billed Gulls.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The highlight of the park is the Nature Area on the eastern side of the park. &nbsp;As one walks toward this area, there is a picnic site on the left that is surrounded by a wall of cottonwoods on one side and a thick row of blackberry brambles on another. &nbsp;The picnic area serves as a good introduction to the Nature Area since the birds, both in numbers and diversity, become instantly apparent here. &nbsp;The entire footpath in the Nature Area has a series of markers numbered 1 through 23. &nbsp;While birds can be seen at any given point within the Nature Area, there are several spots that tend to be more productive than others, particularly numbers 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 and 18. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition to all of the woodland birds mentioned earlier, the following can also be expected. &nbsp;Residents include Red-shouldered and Cooper&rsquo;s Hawks, Great Horned Owl, Belted Kingfisher; Bewick&rsquo;s and House Wrens, Hutton&rsquo;s Vireo (rare), Common Yellowthroat, Spotted Towhee, Song Sparrow, and Red-winged Blackbird. &nbsp;California Quail and Wrentit used to be resident, but that status appears to now be in question. &nbsp;However, both can still be seen or heard on occasion. &nbsp;During periods of migration, the entire area can become alive with migrants. &nbsp;In addition to the previously mentioned warblers, both MacGillivray&rsquo;s and Yellow-breasted Chat can be found. &nbsp;Flycatchers can abound, including Olive-sided (rare), Western Wood-Pewee, Willow, Hammond&rsquo;s, Dusky (rare), Pacific-slope, and Western Kingbird. &nbsp;Other goodies to be expected are Vaux&rsquo;s Swift, Rufous Hummingbird, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, Swainson&rsquo;s Thrush (regular in spring, very rare in fall), Cassin&rsquo;s Vireo, Lazuli Bunting, Chipping Sparrow, and Hooded Oriole. &nbsp;Birds that appear in the fall and often remain through the winter include Winter Wren (rare), Golden-crowned Kinglet; Hermit and Varied Thrushes; Fox, Lincoln&rsquo;s and White-throated Sparrows (rare), Purple Finch (rare) and Pine Siskin.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pig&rsquo;s Lake, at the east end of the Nature Area, is one of the best spots to observe the beautiful Wood Duck up close, particularly during fall and winter. &nbsp;Other species that can be observed at the pond include Green Heron, Great Egret and Great Blue Heron. &nbsp;Occasionally, a Common Moorhen can be found. &nbsp;About one-half of the turtles at Pig&rsquo;s Lake are western pond turtles (native) and one-half are red-eared slider (introduced).</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The park is open to the public every day of the year. &nbsp;The general use area around the lake is not enclosed. &nbsp;The Nature Area has a series of trails throughout with at least one paved path. &nbsp;This area is enclosed by a fence and is usually opened at sunrise and closed at sunset. Watch out for poison oak on some of the side trails. &nbsp;Public restroom stalls are available in the general use area. &nbsp;The topography of the park is totally flat. &nbsp;The dirt paths in the Nature Area are very well maintained, allowing safe passage during the entire year for people of all ages and abilities.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">David Yee</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">From Birding In and Around San Joaquin County (2002), courtesy of David Yee and San Joaquin Audubon Society.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0 c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span></span></p></body></html>
