The westernmost portion of the Jedediah Smith Memorial Trail begins here and can be walked or ridden 30-plus miles to Beal&rsquo;s Point on Folsom Lake at its eastern end. Discovery Park contains streamside habitat, open mowed grass with shade trees and picnic tables, brushy areas of dense shrubs, and riverside woodlands containing towering cottonwoods, oaks, box elders and other riparian species.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">Note: </span><span class="c1">There are homeless camps in the area, so going alone is not recommended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">Birding the Site:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The best way to bird this park is to walk an approximately two-mile loop beginning at the base of the bridge that enters the park from the Garden Highway. Walk along the section of the bike trail just to the left of the bridge that runs south toward the river until it meets the main bike trail. Turn left onto the trail, follow it into the open area along the river, and through the open areas until you reach the small bridge that crosses the slough. At this point, you can retrace this path (that runs along the north side of the slough and parallel to the Garden Highway) or you can turn left onto a dirt trail that leads back to the bridge into the park. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Like the rest of the American River Parkway, this park is a magnet for migrating birds and winter residents such as Hermit Thrush, the crowned sparrows, occasional White-throated Sparrow, Lincoln&rsquo;s Sparrow and Fox Sparrow. California Quail, Bewick&rsquo;s Wren, House Wren, Nuttall&rsquo;s Woodpecker and Downy Woodpecker are year-round residents. Summer has produced Lazuli Bunting and Blue Grosbeak in the broad grassland area between the river and the line of trees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In winter, check the American River for Common Goldeneye and occasional Barrow&rsquo;s Goldeneye. Peregrine Falcons have been found hunting the large pond at the east end of the park, and Western Bluebirds can be found in the open ground near the river. In the spring, American Kestrel, White-tailed Kite, Red-shouldered Hawk and Red- tailed Hawk have all been found nesting in the park. Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk may be found year-round and Sharp-shinned Hawk is found from fall to early spring.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">Entry fee and operations for Discovery Park and other sites on the American River Parkway</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Most access points currently require a $5 entrance fee per vehicle, but there are many sites accessible by foot, bicycle, or public transportation (</span><span class="c4 c1"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sacrt.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNFugkwNF898XgR4f9McffU2rMPWJg">sacrt.com</a></span><span class="c1">). A $50 annual vehicle pass can be purchased from the Sacramento County Department of Parks and Recreation (</span><span class="c4 c1"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.regionalparks.saccounty.net/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNEGF1aJgAYOOLzNQJhyfgNBP-lbXg">sacparks.net</a></span><span class="c1">). A pocket-sized map of the parkway can be purchased at monthly general meetings of the Sacramento Audubon Society, at the Effie Yeaw Nature Center (916-489-4918), or on the Website of the American River Parkway Foundation (</span><span class="c1 c4"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.arpf.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg2vUuU2eTzOIR5P1i8O32Qp4H_w">arpf.org</a></span><span class="c1">). Another valuable resource is Biking and Hiking the American River Parkway, published by the American River Natural History Association (</span><span class="c4 c1"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://arnha.org&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNEA0CkDWdkJEyNqMyYNeyRxZUtDUg">arnha.org</a></span><span class="c1">).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Opening and closing hours change seasonally and are posted at each access. Generally, the sites are open from sunrise to sunset. The Jedediah Smith Memorial Trail (also known as the American River Bike Trail) is a paved bike route that runs the length of the parkway and continues past Lake Natoma to Beal&rsquo;s Point at Folsom Lake. There are additional paved bike routes, a hiking and horse path that parallels the bike trail, and countless informal trails and park service roads to explore. Despite its proximity to over one million people, the parkway is surprisingly under-birded. There are many access points to the parkway in addition to those listed below. We hope that the following pages will encourage you to explore this wonderful area in Sacramento&rsquo;s backyard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c3">Safety</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;</span><span class="c1">Birders should be mindful of bikes speeding along the trail, homeless camps, especially on the lower third of the parkway, and lush stands of poison oak throughout. Rattlesnakes are fairly common, especially on the upper half of the parkway, and mountain lions have been spotted on a few occasions. If leaving a vehicle unattended, it is wise to park in areas that get regular traffic from other park visitors; break-ins are more likely to occur in isolated lots where there are no witnesses.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c7">Maureen Geiger</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
