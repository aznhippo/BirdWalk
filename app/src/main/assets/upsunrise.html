The habitat is similar to Lower Sunrise, but the land rises slightly higher above the river. Shortly below the fish hatchery, one can see toyon and gray pines scattered among the oaks. This is one of the best inland sites in the state for Barrow&rsquo;s Goldeneye and gull watching.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c5">Birding the Site</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the spring, California poppies, styrax with its clusters of white blossoms, and California buckeye put on a colorful display. Bush monkey flower is fairly abundant in the open areas, and Anna&rsquo;s Hummingbirds can be seen sipping nectar from its orange- colored blossoms. Migrating Rufous Hummingbirds and Black-chinned Hummingbirds (spring and summer residents) may also be spotted.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">White-throated Swifts can be seen year-round, and in the spring they are seen flying to and from their nests in the drain holes under the Hazel Avenue bridge. Spring also brings Cliff Swallows who build their bottle- shaped mud nests on the side of the bridge. Northern Rough-winged Swallows and an occasional Barn Swallow can be seen also. Tree Swallows are seen year-round, but are more numerous in the spring. Forster&rsquo;s Terns and an occasional Caspian Tern cruise up and down the river as well as Double-crested Cormorants. Green Heron (often seen inside the hatchery enclosures), Great Egret, Snowy Egret and Great Blue Heron can be seen along the rocky shore across the river. The riparian area along the river is home to Red-shouldered Hawk, occasional Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk, Sharp-shinned Hawk, Red-tailed Hawk and Great Horned Owl. Black Phoebe and Belted Kingfisher forage along the water&rsquo;s edge, and Spotted Sandpiper is often seen on the rocky shore of the river. Bewick&rsquo;s Wren, Spotted Towhee, California Towhee, Oak Titmouse and Bushtit can be seen year-round, and from fall through spring they are joined by White-crowned Sparrow and Golden-crowned Sparrow, Dark-eyed Junco and Ruby-crowned Kinglet. Western Bluebird, Lesser Goldfinch and American Goldfinch can be seen in the more open areas. In the fall and winter, one may see a Phainopepla perched on top of an oak tree or foraging in a cluster of mistletoe.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The main Chinook salmon run begins in October, and hundreds of gulls as well as large numbers of Turkey Vultures arrive to feed on the dying fish. This winter feast may bring in an occasional Bald Eagle. Ospreys are also often seen in winter. Flocks of Common Goldeneye and Common Merganser often have a Barrow&rsquo;s Goldeneye and, occasionally, a Red-breasted Merganser among them. The bluffs by the hatchery offer an excellent viewing place to watch the gulls and ducks, and a careful search through the flocks of Herring Gulls, Ring-billed Gulls and California Gulls may reveal some less common species such as Glaucous-winged Gull, Thayer&rsquo;s Gull, Mew Gull, and, irregularly, Western Gull. Glaucous Gulls have been found at this site, and other rarities are always possible.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">From the hatchery parking area, you can walk past the fish ladder where use trails follow the river bank and eventually connect to the bike trail which leads to the Sunrise Access parking lots and beyond.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">Barbara Mohr</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The entrance fee is currently $5 per vehicle or a $50 annual pass; see the Discovery Park narrative for the information about sites on the American River Parkway.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
