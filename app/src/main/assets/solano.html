fall and winter are most productive, due to the arrival of winter visitors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c4">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">On the drive to the lake, check the orchards for mixed flocks gleaning remnants of the walnut harvest. &nbsp;Large flocks of Wild Turkey have also been seen in these orchards. &nbsp;In spring and summer, along Covell Boulevard, look for Swainson&#39;s Hawks which often feed in the open fields as well as other birds of prey. &nbsp;In the winter, check plowed fields for Mountain Plovers, you may get lucky. &nbsp;Check American Robin flocks for a possible Varied Thrush.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">As you approach the lake, there is a small parking lot on the left at the dam, but as this lot is posted &ldquo;No Parking&rdquo;, continue a bit further until you reach a larger parking lot at the base of a long line of cliffs on the left. &nbsp;Check the cliffs for Great Horned Owls roosting in some of the caves and the brushy cliff-sides for Wrentits, year-round, and Hermit Thrush in winter.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">The lake provides habitat for numerous migrating wading birds and waterfowl. &nbsp;In winter, this is one of the best places for Hooded Mergansers and Osprey. &nbsp;Check the far shoreline for shorebirds, and the near shoreline for wrens, towhees and sparrows. &nbsp;Watch for river otters which are fairly common. &nbsp;It is easy to spend an hour or more here depending on the bird population on the lake. &nbsp;A scope is very helpful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">Leave the parking area and drive west about one mile and turn right onto Pleasants Valley Road. &nbsp;Drive three-quarters of a mile to the park entrance. &nbsp;There is a parking lot on the right. &nbsp;This is a good spot for lunch with picnic tables, restrooms, and big deciduous trees providing shade in the summer. &nbsp;If you missed the Hooded Mergansers at your first stop, they can often be found here. &nbsp;This is also a nice spot for a short walk along the creek with good birding including a possible Red-breasted Sapsucker, Phainopeplas, and recently, a Pileated Woodpecker (check the Central Valley Bird Club listserv for recent reports: &nbsp;groups.yahoo.com/group/central_valley_birds). &nbsp;The park is generally crowded late spring to early fall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">You can walk across the road to the campground and a stroll through these sites may also be productive. &nbsp;Vegetation is denser, and warblers, vireos and other songbirds may be found here during migration. &nbsp;Brown Creepers are often found here in winter, and Hermit Thrush numbers can be astounding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3">To reach Lake Solano Park continue on Putah Creek Road to Pleasants Valley Road. &nbsp;Turn right and go 0.8 mile to the park entrance on your right. &nbsp;This is a fee area, and rangers are enthusiastic about giving tickets to those who do not pay. &nbsp;Also, do not park at the campground unless you are intending to camp, since the staff there is extremely vigilant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c5">June C.
