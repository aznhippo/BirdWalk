There are several small marshes along Road 92B, and this is an especially good area to watch for raptors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">The entire area is crisscrossed by numbered roads, providing many options for wandering the area, all of which can produce interesting birds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c0">Maureen Geiger</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p></body></html>
