You should find House Finches, crowned sparrows, pheasants, and even a Belted Kingfisher. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The Sandhill Cranes will usually first be spotted off in the distance appearing like fence posts or a herd of sheep along the dikes and ditches. &nbsp;Sometimes you may be lucky and find them standing in small groups very near the roadside although generally, they will be further from the road. &nbsp;In the early spring you can watch them display their courting dance. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The ecological reserve is the best place for a spectacular sight at sunset as the cranes return to this area in thousands to roost for the night. &nbsp;The reserve is flooded for the cranes to roost with their feet in water to discourage predators. &nbsp;After the hunting season is over and during the period when the fields are flooded for alkali control, there will be thousands of shorebirds, ducks, geese, and swans feeding and resting in the area. &nbsp;During this time, the cranes will be found standing in large groups along the levees and ditch banks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">At the west end, Woodbridge Road dead-ends at the Mokelumne River, so retrace your route back to the highway, turn left and proceed north back to Peltier Road. &nbsp;Turn left (west) on this road for another crane area. &nbsp;At Blossom Road, turn right and look for Cinnamon Teal, Common Moorhens, Pied-billed Grebes, and American Bitterns in the slough. &nbsp;Where Blossom Road intersects the Walnut Grove-Thornton Road, turn left (west) from Blossom onto this road and proceed 3.0 miles to the Staten Island Road and turn left. &nbsp;Large numbers of cranes and other waterbirds may be seen in the flooded fields. &nbsp;Access here is only from the public road. &nbsp;The end of the public road is clearly marked. &nbsp;There are flooded fields intermittently along the entire length of Walnut Grove-Thornton Road and, depending on the water level, they may be home to thousands of wintering shorebirds and waterfowl. &nbsp;The best time for viewing in this area is November through February. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The only caution for many winter days is the possibility of heavy fog making it almost impossible to see cranes and other wildlife. &nbsp;The state offers guided observation during the height of Sandhill Crane presence, generally on the second Thursdays and Saturdays, and every Sunday of the month from October through the end of February. &nbsp;For specific dates and times, contact the California State Fish and Game Department (916-358-2869 or dfg.ca.gov/regions/3/cranetour).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Cecil and Evelyn Smith; updated by Maureen Geiger</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Staten Island</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Staten Island is another excellent site for viewing large numbers of Sandhill Cranes (as is Cosumnes River Preserve), geese, Tundra Swans, other waterfowl, and shorebirds. In spring and summer, the weedy patches can host Blue Grosbeaks. To reach Staten Island, take Interstate 5 south for 24 miles to the Walnut Grove/Thornton exit. Head west for 3.8 miles on Walnut Grove Road. Shortly after crossing the Mokelumne River, turn left on Staten Island Road. Bird only from the road, as the property is a working agricultural operation. Drive south on Staten Island Road until you reach the signs indicating the end of public access </span></p><p class="c3"><span

class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Woodbridge Regional Park</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">This park consists of lush riparian woodlands nestled along the south bank of the Mokelumne River in the town of Woodbridge. &nbsp;The canopy is comprised largely of cottonwoods and live oaks. &nbsp;Willows and buckeye are also widespread. &nbsp;The understory includes blackberry brambles and poison oak in many places. &nbsp;Stinging nettle is plentiful also.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The entry is lined with pyracantha bushes, so be sure to check for possible Hermit and Varied Thrushes and Fox, Lincoln&rsquo;s, White-crowned and Golden-crowned Sparrows in winter. &nbsp;At the end of these bushes, the park opens up into a fairly wild area. &nbsp;All trails from this point are hard packed dirt which may be muddy in wet weather or impassable during high water. &nbsp;From here, you will see two trail signs in front of you on the left. &nbsp;These trails meander through the woods and eventually meet at an old fence which is the actual park boundary. </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">If you choose to explore this end of the park, give yourself a minimum of two hours, preferably more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">For a much shorter hike, less than an hour, take the unsigned trail that dives into the woods to your right just beyond the first sign pointing to the trail to the left. &nbsp;Or, if you continue straight ahead from the park entrance, you will end up at the river. &nbsp;Any of these choices can yield good birds, depending on the season. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Year-round residents typical of riparian woodlands that can usually be expected include Wood Duck, Common Merganser, Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk, Red-shouldered Hawk, Great Horned Owl, Acorn Woodpecker, Nuttall&rsquo;s Woodpecker, Downy Woodpecker, Belted Kingfisher, Bewick&rsquo;s Wren, Spotted Towhee and Lesser Goldfinch and American Goldfinch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">During summer months, you may find Swainson&rsquo;s Hawk, Western Wood-Pewee, Ash-throated Flycatcher, Northern Rough-winged Swallow, Black-headed Grosbeak, Lazuli Bunting and Bullock&rsquo;s Oriole. &nbsp;Birding this area in winter may turn up Red-breasted Sapsucker, Hutton&rsquo;s Vireo, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Brown Creeper, Winter Wren and Golden-crowned Kinglet in addition to the usual winter warblers and Purple Finch and Pine Siskin. &nbsp;Spring and fall migration can produce Olive-sided Flycatcher, Willow Flycatcher, Pacific-slope Flycatcher, Cassin&rsquo;s Vireo, Warbling Vireo, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, Swainson&rsquo;s Thrush, Western Tanager and all western migrant warblers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Jim Rowoth</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">From Birding in and Around San Joaquin County (2002), courtesy of Jim Rowoth and the San Joaquin Audubon Society.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Lodi Lake </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Lodi Lake Park is truly one of the premier birding areas in San Joaquin County. &nbsp;This reputation is well deserved as nearly 200 species (over 50% of the county&rsquo;s total bird list) have been observed within the boundaries of this 125-acre jewel along the Mokelumne River in north Lodi. &nbsp;Good safety and maintenance, and easy access and observation all help to give the park year-round appeal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Birding the site: &nbsp;Lodi Lake Park attracts primarily riparian and open woodland birds. &nbsp;Despite the presence of the Mokelumne River and the lake, there are no true wetlands within the park. Bird groups such as waterfowl, divers, shorebirds, terns and rails are not to be expected in any kind of numbers either as residents or migrants. &nbsp;However, there are enough marginal wetlands present so that with the rich riparian woodland present, one can almost expect any bird found within the Central Valley at the proper season.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The mature trees and lawn area at the park entrance and along Laurel Avenue attract a wide variety of birds all year long. &nbsp;Residents include Mourning Dove, Anna&rsquo;s Hummingbird (check the feeders along Laurel Avenue), Nuttall&rsquo;s and Downy Woodpeckers; Black Phoebe, Western Scrub Jay, Oak Titmouse, Bushtit, White-breasted Nuthatch, Brewer&rsquo;s Blackbird, House Finch, and both Lesser and American Goldfinches. &nbsp;During both periods of migration, nearly every species of warbler can be found, including Orange-crowned, Nashville, Yellow, Black-throated Gray, Townsend&rsquo;s, Hermit, and Wilson&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Other migrants to be expected include Warbling Vireo, Western Tanager, and Black-headed Grosbeak. &nbsp;Spring arrivals that stay to nest in this area include Black-chinned Hummingbird; Barn, Northern Rough-winged, and Tree Swallows, Ash-throated Flycatcher, and Bullock&rsquo;s Oriole. &nbsp;Birds that arrive in fall that spend the winter include Red-breasted Nuthatch (rare), Cedar Waxwing, Ruby-crowned Kinglet, Yellow-rumped Warbler, and both White-crowned and Golden-crowned Sparrows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">When the lake is drawn down from October to March, the diversity can be quite high, especially in late fall and early winter. &nbsp;One can expect American White Pelican (rare), Double-crested Cormorant, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, Snowy Egret, Green-winged Teal, Common Merganser, Killdeer, Black-necked Stilt, Greater Yellowlegs, Least Sandpiper, Dunlin, Long-billed Dowitcher, and California and Ring-billed Gulls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The highlight of the park is the Nature Area on the eastern side of the park. &nbsp;As one walks toward this area, there is a picnic site on the left that is surrounded by a wall of cottonwoods on one side and a thick row of blackberry brambles on another. &nbsp;The picnic area serves as a good introduction to the Nature Area since the birds, both in numbers and diversity, become instantly apparent here. &nbsp;The entire footpath in the Nature Area has a series of markers numbered 1 through 23. &nbsp;While birds can be seen at any given point within the Nature Area, there are several spots that tend to be more productive than others, particularly numbers 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 and 18. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">In addition to all of the woodland birds mentioned earlier, the following can also be expected. &nbsp;Residents include Red-shouldered and Cooper&rsquo;s Hawks, Great Horned Owl, Belted Kingfisher; Bewick&rsquo;s and House Wrens, Hutton&rsquo;s Vireo (rare), Common Yellowthroat, Spotted Towhee, Song Sparrow, and Red-winged Blackbird. &nbsp;California Quail and Wrentit used to be resident, but that status appears to now be in question. &nbsp;However, both can still be seen or heard on occasion. &nbsp;During periods of migration, the entire area can become alive with migrants. &nbsp;In addition to the previously mentioned warblers, both MacGillivray&rsquo;s and Yellow-breasted Chat can be found. &nbsp;Flycatchers can abound, including Olive-sided (rare), Western Wood-Pewee, Willow, Hammond&rsquo;s, Dusky (rare), Pacific-slope, and Western Kingbird. &nbsp;Other goodies to be expected are Vaux&rsquo;s Swift, Rufous Hummingbird, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, Swainson&rsquo;s Thrush (regular in spring, very rare in fall), Cassin&rsquo;s Vireo, Lazuli Bunting, Chipping Sparrow, and Hooded Oriole. &nbsp;Birds that appear in the fall and often remain through the winter include Winter Wren (rare), Golden-crowned Kinglet; Hermit and Varied Thrushes; Fox, Lincoln&rsquo;s and White-throated Sparrows (rare), Purple Finch (rare) and Pine Siskin.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Pig&rsquo;s Lake, at the east end of the Nature Area, is one of the best spots to observe the beautiful Wood Duck up close, particularly during fall and winter. &nbsp;Other species that can be observed at the pond include Green Heron, Great Egret and Great Blue Heron. &nbsp;Occasionally, a Common Moorhen can be found. &nbsp;About one-half of the turtles at Pig&rsquo;s Lake are western pond turtles (native) and one-half are red-eared slider (introduced).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">The park is open to the public every day of the year. &nbsp;The general use area around the lake is not enclosed. &nbsp;The Nature Area has a series of trails throughout with at least one paved path. &nbsp;This area is enclosed by a fence and is usually opened at sunrise and closed at sunset. Watch out for poison oak on some of the side trails. &nbsp;Public restroom stalls are available in the general use area. &nbsp;The topography of the park is totally flat. &nbsp;The dirt paths in the Nature Area are very well maintained, allowing safe passage during the entire year for people of all ages and abilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">David Yee</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">From Birding In and Around San Joaquin County (2002), courtesy of David Yee and San Joaquin Audubon Society.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6"></span></p></body></html>
