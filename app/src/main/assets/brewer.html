calls is very helpful. &nbsp;Chestnut-collared, Lapland, and McCown&rsquo;s Longspurs have been found here (late fall through early spring). &nbsp;The first Ruff and Glossy Ibis for Placer County were reported here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Heading north on Brewer Road from Nicolaus Road, it is 2.0 miles north to Wise Road, &nbsp;2.6 miles to Hicks Road, 3.0 miles to Waltz Road, and 4.0 miles to Kempton Road. &nbsp;There is a nice bit of riparian at Hicks Road. &nbsp;Wise and Waltz Roads both go east for 4.0 miles to the north/south running Dowd Road. &nbsp;Kempton Road makes its way east to Placer Road, which goes north to both Dalby and Riosa Roads; both of these lead to Dowd Road. &nbsp;Pleasant Grove Road, to the west, runs parallel with Brewer Road. &nbsp;It is worth checking, though the traffic is often heavy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raptors, including Bald Eagles, Ferruginous Hawks, Rough-legged Hawks (variable year to year), Prairie Falcons, and Merlins are regularly recorded in winter. &nbsp;Short-eared Owls may be found at dusk&mdash;recently a good number were found on Waltz Road (1.5 miles east of Brewer Road, west of the Placer/Sutter County line). &nbsp;Depending on water levels, check promising fields for shorebirds and waterfowl. &nbsp;Careful scrutiny of Tundra Swan flocks might produce Trumpeter Swans or Bewick&rsquo;s Swans. &nbsp;Also, check the sparrow flocks. &nbsp;There can be astonishing numbers of Savannah Sparrows and White-crowned Sparrows, and the occasional Vesper Sparrow is found. &nbsp;Tricolored Blackbirds are usually among the blackbird flocks in winter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bruce Webb suggests checking Moore Road where it crosses Auburn Ravine Creek (1.0 mile east of Dowd Road, or 5.0 miles east of Brewer Road). &nbsp;Moore Road is 2.0 miles south of Nicolaus Road. &nbsp;Least Flycatcher and Blackpoll Warbler have been found there. &nbsp;
