Oak Woodlands</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The following is one of five sections provide details on great birding areas from fall through spring. &nbsp;They can be combined into a full day of birding, or taken in sections as time allows. &nbsp;The main attraction for most birders is the chance to see winter raptors and Lewis&rsquo;s Woodpeckers in a relatively natural setting. &nbsp;It must be mentioned that the areas along Scott and White Rock Roads are under extreme development pressure, and the descriptions that follow are of the areas as they exist today. &nbsp;The Sacramento Valley Conservancy spearheaded a multi-partner effort to purchase 4,000 acres through which Latrobe Road travels&mdash;Deer Creek Hills. &nbsp;Determined efforts to preserve open space in the southeastern county are vital if we are to continue enjoying these wonderful birding areas.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Note</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;Scott Road and White Rock Road are experiencing increasingly heavy traffic, so use caution and pull completely off of the road when parking.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c4">Michigan Bar</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Here you find a similar mix of habitats and species as described in the previous section, but with the addition of the Cosumnes River.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c3">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The area adjacent to the river has the most to offer. &nbsp;Many of Sacramento County&rsquo;s infrequent reports of Hairy Woodpeckers, Steller&rsquo;s Jays, and Band-tailed Pigeons (all rare) are from here. &nbsp;An American Dipper (very rare) has been found here as well, and Lawrence&rsquo;s Goldfinches are sometimes present. &nbsp;Often none of these species are present, but it is always worth a look.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">From Highway 16 (Jackson Highway), travel 1.2 miles on Michigan Bar Road to the Cosumnes River. &nbsp;Cross the bridge and park on the far side. &nbsp;From the bridge you can look and listen for a Hairy Woodpecker or Steller&rsquo;s Jay in and around the trees above the residence. &nbsp;Ducks and Canada Geese are often on the river. &nbsp;Please respect the privacy of the property owner.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Beyond the river, the road is unpaved and can be muddy after a storm. &nbsp;Shortly, the blue oak woodland gives way to open grassland. &nbsp;Mountain Bluebirds (rare) have been found in the open country along with winter raptors. &nbsp;Vesper Sparrows have been seen along this stretch. &nbsp;During fall migration, Common Poorwills and Burrowing Owls have been seen on the road after dark. &nbsp;At mile 4.1 you reach the junction with Latrobe Road described in the previous section. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0
