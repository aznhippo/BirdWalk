Grasslands and Blue Oak Woodlands</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The following is one of five sections provide details on great birding areas from fall through spring. &nbsp;They can be combined into a full day of birding, or taken in sections as time allows. &nbsp;The main attraction for most birders is the chance to see winter raptors and Lewis&rsquo;s Woodpeckers in a relatively natural setting. &nbsp;It must be mentioned that the areas along Scott and White Rock Roads are under extreme development pressure, and the descriptions that follow are of the areas as they exist today. &nbsp;The Sacramento Valley Conservancy spearheaded a multi-partner effort to purchase 4,000 acres through which Latrobe Road travels&mdash;Deer Creek Hills. &nbsp;Determined efforts to preserve open space in the southeastern county are vital if we are to continue enjoying these wonderful birding areas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c5">Note</span><span class="c3">: &nbsp;Scott Road and White Rock Road are experiencing increasingly heavy traffic, so use caution and pull completely off of the road when parking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c5">Latrobe Road (Deer Creek Hills)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">With a mix of blue oak woodland, savanna, and expansive grasslands, a trip along Latrobe Road has a diversity of habitats and is one of the only areas in Sacramento County to have a real sense of remoteness. &nbsp;Even if the birding is slow, the scenery makes the trip worthwhile. &nbsp;Please note that a vehicle with moderate clearance is required to travel beyond the second crossing of Crevis Creek, but four-wheel-drive is not needed. &nbsp;Also, due to its remoteness, Latrobe Road often serves as an illegal dumping ground and as an occasional shooting gallery. &nbsp;Caution is always advised, and going with a friend is wise. &nbsp;Docent-led walks are offered by the Sacramento Valley Conservancy, and a public access plan is in development. &nbsp;For more information: </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4"

the mostly well-graded dirt road at Latrobe Road&rsquo;s junction with Stone House Road. &nbsp;Within the first mile, much of the species diversity is encountered, so if you have a passenger car and can only access this section, it is still worth a visit. &nbsp;Lewis&rsquo;s Woodpeckers are often present near this junction and near the second creek crossing, though their numbers vary widely from year to year. &nbsp;At the rocky canyon area at mile 0.4, it is always worth getting out of the car and looking around. &nbsp;This is one of the best places in Sacramento County for Rock Wrens and Rufous-crowned Sparrows away from Folsom Lake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Typical foothill species such as Western Bluebirds, Lark Sparrows, and Lesser Goldfinches abound. &nbsp;Less commonly, you may encounter a Phainopepla. &nbsp;Lawrence&rsquo;s Goldfinches occur here irregularly in winter, but typically breed in the area in low numbers. &nbsp;If very lucky, you could find Band-tailed Pigeons, a Hairy Woodpecker, Steller&rsquo;s Jays, a Greater Roadrunner, or a Northern Pygmy-Owl. &nbsp;Owling attempts may be rewarded with Lesser Nighthawks, Common Poorwill, Western Screech-Owls, and Great Horned Owls. &nbsp;This area is under-birded and has a lot of potential.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">The first creek crossing can usually be negotiated by a passenger car. &nbsp;The second crossing, at mile 1.0, is often flooded, but usually passable in a vehicle with moderate clearance and a driver with a little courage. &nbsp;A third creek crossing is a little rougher than the first, but usually poses no serious obstacle. &nbsp;Be careful and know your car&rsquo;s limits; walking is also an option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">At 2.4 miles, the blue oaks give way to open country with a species mix like that described for Scott Road. &nbsp;Mountain Bluebirds (rare) are sometimes found here. &nbsp;Spring wildflowers are a highlight not to be missed. &nbsp;The road is muddy after a rain and often has large puddles, but is usually passable. &nbsp;It was along this section that the Central Valley&rsquo;s first Cassin&rsquo;s Sparrow was found.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">At the junction at mile 4.0, Michigan Bar Road heads to the right (see the next section). &nbsp;If you go straight ahead, Latrobe Road changes to South Shingle Road (the signs are often down or shot). &nbsp;Continuing straight, you travel through similar open country and cross shortly into El Dorado County on a rough and sometimes muddy route. &nbsp;At mile 6.0 you reach pavement and the advance of development which may continue to sprawl all the way to the county line. &nbsp;At mile 8.0, you reach the other Latrobe Road; the name changes are a source of much confusion. &nbsp;After a left turn and another eight miles, you will reach El Dorado Hills and Highway 50.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Back at mile 4.0, a right turn onto Michigan Bar Road will take you over the Cosumnes River and toward Highway 16 (Jackson Highway). &nbsp;If traveled in reverse, this is an alternate access to the areas above the second crossing of Crevis Creek. &nbsp;See the following section for more details.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p
