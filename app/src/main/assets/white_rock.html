class="c3 c0">Southeastern Sacramento County Grasslands and Blue Oak Woodlands</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The following is one of five sections provide details on great birding areas from fall through spring. &nbsp;They can be combined into a full day of birding, or taken in sections as time allows. &nbsp;The main attraction for most birders is the chance to see winter raptors and Lewis&rsquo;s Woodpeckers in a relatively natural setting. &nbsp;It must be mentioned that the areas along Scott and White Rock Roads are under extreme development pressure, and the descriptions that follow are of the areas as they exist today. &nbsp;The Sacramento Valley Conservancy spearheaded a multi-partner effort to purchase 4,000 acres through which Latrobe Road travels&mdash;Deer Creek Hills. &nbsp;Determined efforts to preserve open space in the southeastern county are vital if we are to continue enjoying these wonderful birding areas.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">Note</span><span class="c0">: &nbsp;Scott Road and White Rock Road are experiencing increasingly heavy traffic, so use caution and pull completely off of the road when parking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3 c0">White Rock and Payen Roads</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vast grassland expanses and rolling hills provide excellent opportunities to look for Ferruginous Hawks, Prairie Falcons, and other winter raptors. &nbsp;Payen Road has few cars and allows a leisurely visit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c3">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the corrals by the junction of White Rock and Scott Roads, there is a safe place to park where you can scan for raptors. &nbsp;Sparrows are often on or near the corrals.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the corral, travel 1.2 miles east to Payen Road. &nbsp;The cattle enclosures usually host a large flock of blackbirds. &nbsp;You may be able to find Brown-headed Cowbirds, Tricolored Blackbirds, and, rarely, Yellow-headed Blackbirds among the abundant Red-winged Blackbirds and Brewer&rsquo;s Blackbirds. &nbsp;Payen Road travels south for 1.5 miles past a model airplane staging area and ends at private property. &nbsp;There are few places to pull completely off the road, but since there is very little traffic, pull over and it is usually safe get out of your car. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From mid-October through March, a Prairie Falcon is often present along the road and Ferruginous Hawks may be sitting on the hillsides to the south. &nbsp;Golden Eagles, Rough-legged Hawks, and Merlins are found here, though not quite so dependably. &nbsp;Check the fields and the abandoned railroad culverts for Burrowing Owls.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Placerville Road heads north from the White Rock/Payen Road junction for 1.4 miles to Highway 50 (no on-ramp). &nbsp;It has similar habitat, but more traffic. &nbsp;Alternately, you can begin the next tour by heading west on White Rock Road for 2.5 miles from Payen Road, and heading south on Scott Road.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c4">Chris Conard</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c1
