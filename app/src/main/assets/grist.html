Reichmuth Park and Babel Slough are among the very few other small sites in the Sacramento area with a similar track record. Jeri Langham and his cadre of friends and students scour it, sometimes several times a day, during migration. Gristmill is big enough to attract and hold interesting birds, but small enough and open enough to allow for good coverage.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c3">Birding the site:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">From the parking area, there are informal trails heading both upstream and downstream. Heading upstream near the river, the trail overlooks a bluff with nesting Northern Rough-winged Swallows. There are often many waterbirds visible on the large pond on the north side of the river (William B. Pond Recreation Area). Access extends for only about a quarter-mile in this direction, but it can be quite productive, and you can make a loop by returning on a different trail farther from the river. Heading downstream from the parking area, an informal trail goes through nice stands of willows and cottonwoods. These give way to stands of non-native black locust and some non- native elm. Alders and willows line the riverbank. There are several spots with open views of the river, and Barrow&rsquo;s Goldeneyes are sometimes found among the Common Goldeneyes and Common Mergansers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The parkway narrows shortly after crossing the Mayhew Drain, about one mile downstream from the parking area, though you may continue all the way to the Watt access, over two miles from the Gristmill access. A few large oaks often harbor Black-throated Gray Warblers, among other species, during spring and fall, and occasionally they overwinter. Larchmont Park, a quarter-mile downstream of the Mayhew Drain, just outside of the levee, has hosted a Red-naped Sapsucker and Sacramento County&rsquo;s only Cape May Warbler. Yellow-billed Magpies, Western Bluebirds, and Lark Sparrows are often seen here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c4">Chris Conard</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The entrance fee is currently $5 per vehicle or a $50 annual pass; see the Discovery Park narrative for the information about sites on the American River Parkway.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
