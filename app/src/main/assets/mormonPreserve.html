however, staff at Brown&rsquo;s Ravine have been resistant to honoring fees paid at self-registration sites. &nbsp;If your visit will include Brown&rsquo;s Ravine, getting your pass there first may save aggravation. &nbsp;Electronic payment stations have been installed at some access points. &nbsp;Unfortunately, they are not always working properly. &nbsp;For the latest on fees and other information, call the district office at 916-988-0205, or visit the state parks&rsquo; Web site (parks.ca.gov).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Folsom Point</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;juts out into the lake and is one of several good areas for scoping waterbirds. &nbsp;The open oak woodland usually harbors fair numbers of Western Bluebirds and other expected species for this habitat. &nbsp;Drive to the picnic area at the end of the road and scan the water. &nbsp;A spotting scope is almost essential to identify any but the closest birds.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Not far from Folsom Point is the </span><span class="c2 c3">Mormon Island Preserve</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(see directions. &nbsp;Along Green Valley Road, just before reaching Sophia Parkway, the Mormon Island Preserve will be on your right. &nbsp;You can park along Green Valley Road and walk through an opening in the fence. &nbsp;Alternately, a right turn on Shadowfax Lane, in another 0.2 mile, will take you to the Mormon Island Cemetery. &nbsp;You can park at the end of the road. &nbsp;There aren&rsquo;t many trees in the cemetery, but the old headstones are interesting and there have been Red-breasted Sapsuckers here. &nbsp;You can check the Mormon Island Preserve by walking along Shadowfax Lane and walking the informal paths through the woods. &nbsp;It can be good for sparrows in winter and migrants in season. &nbsp;Wood Ducks and Hooded Mergansers (irregular) can be found in the ponds. &nbsp;Rubber boots might be needed since it is often soggy or partially flooded. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Back on Green Valley Road, at the intersection with Sophia Parkway, turn left to reach the </span><span class="c3 c2">Mormon Island lake access.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; From the parking area, walk up the hill to get another view of the lake, and continue on a trail toward Brown&rsquo;s Ravine. &nbsp;Rock Wrens are often found in the rocks on and near the dike, and Rufous-crowned Sparrows may be present. &nbsp;The trail from here to Brown&rsquo;s Ravine has proven to be an excellent location for Phainopeplas. &nbsp;Hairy Woodpeckers (perhaps just one pair) and Purple Finches are also regularly found.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Another mile east on Green Valley Road will take you to </span><span class="c3 c2">Brown&rsquo;s Ravine.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; Turn left. &nbsp;Immediately past the entrance kiosk is a road on the right leading to a small parking area. &nbsp;This is a trailhead that can take you back across the park road, through nice oak woodland toward the Mormon Island access (about two miles). &nbsp;The trail goes for many miles in the other direction as well. &nbsp;Brown&rsquo;s Ravine is also a good location for scanning the lake. &nbsp;Drive past the marina to the end of the road at the boat ramp. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From Brown&rsquo;s Ravine, continue east on Green Valley Road for 0.7 mile and turn left on Salmon Falls Road. &nbsp;Unfortunately, many of the good locations to check along Salmon Falls Road, such as New York Creek, are now marked with &ldquo;No Parking&rdquo; signs. &nbsp;One exception is the large dirt lot (no fee) at Falcon Crest Lane on the north side of Salmon Falls Road (2.9 miles from Green Valley Road). &nbsp;Currently, there is an old wooden sign, but the metal street sign for Falcon Crest is missing. &nbsp;You can park here and walk a portion of the Monte Vista Trail (it is 3.5 miles to New York Creek). &nbsp;You can also walk or drive down the nicely forested steep road for 0.4 mile to a parking area ($3 fee). &nbsp;If the water is low, there are good views of the Old Salmon Falls Bridge in the lake. &nbsp;With two cars, you could do a very long shuttle hike between here and Brown&rsquo;s Ravine (12 miles).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There is still legal parking (no fee) at </span><span class="c3 c2">Sweetwater Creek. </span><span class="c2">&nbsp;From Brown&rsquo;s Ravine, continue east on Green Valley Road for 0.7 mile. &nbsp;Turn left on Salmon Falls Road and go 3.8 miles (0.9 mile beyond Falcon Crest Lane). &nbsp;Immediately after crossing the creek, park in the dirt lot on the left side of the road. &nbsp;The upstream portion of the riparian is private property and is conspicuously signed. &nbsp;From the parking area (be careful of the traffic), listen for singing California Thrashers and Yellow-breasted Chats. &nbsp;Mountain Quail may be heard on the chaparral slopes above. &nbsp;You can walk the park land on the north side of Salmon Falls Road down to Folsom Lake. &nbsp;The vegetation here is a mix of oak woodland and chaparral, with a thin band of riparian along Sweetwater Creek. &nbsp;It is best here in early morning. &nbsp;Continue another 0.2 mile east on Salmon Falls Road (4.0 miles from Green Valley Road) to one of the few places where you can pull off the road. &nbsp;It is worth a quick stop to listen for more chaparral species. &nbsp;Unfortunately, enormous houses are carving up swaths of the habitat here.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Continuing 1.8 miles on Salmon Falls Road from </span><span class="c2">Sweetwater Creek</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(5.6 miles from Green Valley Road) will lead to a left turn toward a large parking area for the </span><span class="c3 c2">Sweetwater Trail</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;($3 fee). &nbsp;It is a nice walk through oak woodland, high above the upper reaches of Folsom Lake.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p></body></html>
