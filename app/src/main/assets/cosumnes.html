In spring and summer, mosquitoes can be abundant and aggressive. &nbsp;Ticks can also be numerous if you leave the trail. &nbsp;Bring repellent. &nbsp;Mountain lions have been reported on several occasions.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4 c0">Birding the site</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Two trails radiate out from the visitor center: &nbsp;the one-mile Wetlands Walk and the three-mile River Walk. &nbsp;The Wetlands Walk goes along the Lost Slough Wetlands to the west of Franklin Boulevard. &nbsp;A scope is helpful to spot distant waterfowl. &nbsp;The boardwalk heading west from the Wetlands Walk can be excellent for rails. &nbsp;Sandhill Cranes (late September to early March) are often fairly close to the trail. &nbsp;In spring and summer, Blue Grosbeaks sit up and sing from the low vegetation. &nbsp;Continuing north on the trail, you can cross Franklin Boulevard and loop back to the visitor center via the foot bridge or keep going on the River Walk.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The River Walk begins at the visitor center by crossing Willow Slough on a substantial foot bridge. &nbsp;The bridge provides an excellent vantage point for seeing songbirds in the adjacent riparian vegetation. &nbsp;On the east side of the slough, the wetlands provide good views of waterfowl and other waterbirds. &nbsp;Swamp Sparrows have been found here and elsewhere on the wetland edges. &nbsp;For a half-mile, the trail stays near the wetlands, where rails, American Bitterns, and Common Yellowthroats can often be seen or heard.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The trail passes through a mix of habitats, with willow-dominated and oak-dominated riparian forest, and areas of oak savanna. &nbsp;In spring and fall, there can be an excellent movement of songbird migrants. &nbsp;Wrentits call from the underbrush, and in spring and summer the songs of Bewick&rsquo;s Wrens, House Wrens, and Spotted Towhees fill the air. &nbsp;Several species of eastern warblers have been found along the trail, including Prothonotary and Black-throated Blue Warbler. &nbsp;As the trail reaches the Cosumnes River, it comes to a nice patch of mature valley oaks. &nbsp;The trail will lead you under railroad tracks, through an open section, then close to the river in a forest of medium-sized valley oaks. &nbsp;This area is known as &ldquo;the Point&rdquo; and has produced many of the preserve&rsquo;s interesting records. &nbsp;There are benches next to the river to allow a break from walking. &nbsp;The trail makes a partial loop through grassland and oak savanna, then backtracks to the visitor center. &nbsp;Despite all that this trail has to offer, there are many mornings when there are no birders to find its avian surprises. &nbsp;The first group out in the morning often flushes several flocks of Wood Ducks and may see river otters and beavers.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Desmond Road is excellent for waterfowl and crane viewing. &nbsp;Mornings and evenings can be spectacular. &nbsp;It goes east from Franklin Boulevard, one mile south of Twin Cities Road or 0.7 mile north of the visitor center. &nbsp;It is one of the better places to find Eurasian Wigeon and often harbors thousands of Greater White-fronted Geese. &nbsp;Check the wetlands on either side of the road and along Bruceville Road going north toward Twin Cities Road. &nbsp;Along Bruceville, the large microwave tower often serves as a lookout for a Peregrine Falcon.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To explore the Valensin portion of the preserve to the east of Highway 99, take Twin Cities Road six miles east of Bruceville Road and go north on Highway 99 for two miles to Arno Road. &nbsp;Exit and head east on Arno Road. &nbsp;Dairies along this and other roads in the area can host large flocks of blackbirds, including Tricolored Blackbirds. &nbsp;In 0.4 mile you might want to check the small cemetery on the north side of Arno Road. &nbsp;The old headstones are interesting and this is a good area to scan the grasslands well away from the road, with its sparse but often speeding traffic. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the grasslands and agricultural lands for raptors, cranes, and Long-billed Curlews. &nbsp;In another 1.2 miles, turn left to stay on Arno Road. &nbsp;Continue north and it will become Riley Road. &nbsp;This section of road has little traffic, and allows for more relaxed observations. &nbsp;Near the second creek crossing, look for raised areas to the east of the road that might harbor Burrowing Owls. &nbsp;They have been seen along this stretch and along Salas Road heading east from Riley Road. &nbsp;The grasslands in this area often host Ferruginous Hawks. &nbsp;Horned Lark flocks in the area have contained longspurs. &nbsp;Riley joins Dillard Road, and a left turn will take you back to Highway 99 in 2.7 miles. &nbsp;If you still feel like exploring, head east on Dillard Road beyond the preserve. &nbsp;Between Dillard and Twin Cities Roads, Alta Mesa and Clay Station Roads can be productive for open country birds. &nbsp;Continuing east on Twin Cities Road will take you to Rancho Seco and the Howard Ranch described below.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p></body></html>
