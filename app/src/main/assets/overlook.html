calls). &nbsp;Also listen for the questioning whistle of Phainopeplas here and elsewhere around the lake.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For another view of the lake, go to the </span><span class="c1">Willow Creek access</span><span class="c2">. &nbsp;Return to Highway 50 on Hazel Avenue, go east for 0.9 mile, and exit at Folsom Boulevard. &nbsp;Make a left on Folsom Boulevard, and go 1.5 miles to Blue Ravine Road. &nbsp;Make a U-turn and backtrack on Folsom for 0.7 mile and make a right. &nbsp;There are good views of the lake, a cove where kayakers launch their crafts, and a nice section of the bike trail crossing the creek if you walk north along the trail from the northeast end of the parking area. &nbsp;There are also nice woods along the entrance road. &nbsp;From the far end of the dirt parking area, walk to the main lakeshore and look across to a Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, and Double-crested Cormorant rookery in the tall gray pines (March-June).</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Negro Bar</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;provides several viewpoints of the upper portion of the lake, as well as a nice mix of oak woodland, gray pine, and a small patch of chaparral. &nbsp;From Highway 50 and Folsom Boulevard, go north for 3.6 miles (From Willow Creek, make a U-turn at Natoma Station Drive, and take Folsom Boulevard north for 3.0 miles to Greenback Avenue). &nbsp;Turn left at Greenback Avenue, then make a left to the Negro Bar access in 0.3 mile. &nbsp;The far parking lot and picnic area is reached by heading right once you reach the first large parking area. &nbsp;From here, you can walk down to the lake with your scope, walk the lakeshore along the bike path (the bluffs here are also good for Rufous-crowned Sparrows), or visit the small path of chaparral between the parking area and Greenback Avenue. &nbsp;If you have the time, there are other roads and trails to explore.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Folsom Rodeo Grounds</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;area provides access to the upper portion of Lake Natoma and the remaining scenic portions of the American River Canyon below the Folsom Dam. &nbsp;From Highway 50, take Folsom Boulevard north for 2.7 miles and turn right on Natoma Street. &nbsp;After one mile, turn left at Stafford Street. &nbsp;Continue 0.2 mile to a large parking area near the Rodeo Grounds. &nbsp;From the lower right (northwest) edge of the parking area, walk between the Rodeo Grounds and the trees, take the trail down the slope to the left, and then</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;head right, descending toward the river canyon. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll reach a set of stairs that takes you up on the old Folsom Powerhouse Canal Road. &nbsp;Head to the right along a marshy section of canal with nice views of the river canyon. &nbsp;The path ends at a fence for Folsom Prison. &nbsp;Back at the stairway, if you go downstream you will come to a bridge crossing a small creek, then a bike trail. &nbsp;Turn left up the hill on the trail and left on Leidesdorff Street. &nbsp;Continue on Leidesdorff, and then follow a bike trail up the hill to the right as it winds back to the parking area.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p></body></html>
