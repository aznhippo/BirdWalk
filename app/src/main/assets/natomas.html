To find them, look for cattle and standing water in grassy areas with blackberry bushes growing on paddock fences. &nbsp;Scan every flock, as they travel with Brewer&rsquo;s Blackbirds and Red-winged Blackbirds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Rice fields and canals attract many different species, including Black-crowned Night-Heron, Green Heron, Black-necked Stilt, American Avocet, White-faced Ibis, Double-crested Cormorant, Cinnamon Teal, Pied-billed Grebe, Long-billed Curlew, American Coot and Common Moorhen. &nbsp;As you travel through the rice fields, be on the lookout for Black Terns. &nbsp;Perhaps you will be the first person in over 50 years to report a breeding pair in Sacramento County. &nbsp;In the winter, the fields host a large number of migratory ducks, geese and shorebirds, and weedy fields and roadside tangles host a variety of sparrows. &nbsp;Watch for Loggerhead Shrikes and, in summer, Western Kingbirds on the power lines.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The riparian area along the Garden Highway is rife with Oak Titmouse, Downy Woodpecker, and Nuttall&rsquo;s Woodpecker, year-round, and migrant warblers, Western Tanagers, and other songbirds in spring and fall. &nbsp;Raptors common to the area are Red-tailed Hawks, Red-shouldered Hawks, American Kestrels, White-tailed Kites and Northern Harriers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Going east on Elverta Road to the East Levee Road, scan the fields and irrigation ditches. &nbsp;Turn right on East Levee Road and stop where it is safe to view waterfowl, shorebirds and waders in Steelhead Creek. &nbsp;Continue south on East Levee Road to Elkhorn Boulevard. At the southeast corner of the intersection, you reach the gravel parking lot for the Ueda Parkway (see the next section). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">On Elkhorn Boulevard, 0.5 mile west of East Levee Road (or 2.4 miles east of Highway 99), there is an old gravel road where you can park on the north side of the road. &nbsp;As many as a dozen Burrowing Owls have been seen in this area on both sides of the road.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">Carl Burke</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0 c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span></span></p></body></html>
