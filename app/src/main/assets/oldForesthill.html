</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Additional trailheads can be reached by taking Old Foresthill Road straight ahead instead of following Highway 49 to the right across the river. &nbsp;There are a few parking spaces immediately on your right overlooking the confluence. &nbsp;A steep hiking trail runs directly up the hill along a small creek. &nbsp;This area is very lush, with some Douglas firs. &nbsp;If you take this trail, you will reach the Old Stage Road trail in about 0.5 mile. &nbsp;You can turn right and make a loop back to Old Foresthill Road via the Old Stage. &nbsp;It is an easier hike to run in reverse, taking the steep cut-off on the way down, but it can be hard to see if you are coming up on the Old Stage Road.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To reach the </span><span class="c0">Old Stage Road trailhead</span><span class="c1">, continue on Old Foresthill Road for 0.3 mile and park in the dirt lot on the left. &nbsp;The trail climbs steadily but reasonably through mixed oak woodland for two miles before reaching the outskirts of Auburn. &nbsp;By mid-morning, there are often many Turkey Vultures aloft, along with a few Red-tailed Hawks. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just across the river on Old Foresthill Road from the previous site is the </span><span class="c0">trail to Lake Clementine</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;It runs for about two miles, going under the Foresthill Bridge, along the North Fork to an impressive waterfall created by water falling over the North Fork Dam. &nbsp;Canyon Wrens have been found near the dam, and Yellow-breasted Chats have been reported along this trail in the tangles near the river. &nbsp;Across from the trailhead to Lake Clementine, there are bedrock mortars in the rocks, at the apex where the two forks of the river come together. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You can also reach Lake Clementine by car from Foresthill Road. &nbsp;Along the way, there is a good location for Sage Sparrows just after you cross the Foresthill Bridge (1.3 miles from Interstate 80). &nbsp;Park at a pull-out on the left side of the road by a green gate and walk up the hill into the good chaparral habitat. &nbsp;Other chaparral species, such as California Thrashers, may be found here. &nbsp;If you park near the bridge, you can walk onto it for excellent views of the North Fork of the American River below. &nbsp;The road to Lake Clementine is 3.3 miles from Interstate 80. &nbsp;Turn left, and it is 2.5 miles to the lake.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Another excellent site is </span><span class="c0">Driver&rsquo;s Flat</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;Turn right off of Foresthill Road 7.8 miles from Interstate 80. &nbsp;Scott Hoppe reports that this is an excellent site for Yellow-breasted Chats spring, as well as Band-tailed Pigeons, Calliope Hummingbirds, Steller&rsquo;s Jays, and Chipping Sparrows among the expected foothills species. &nbsp;Park in a gravel lot 0.4 mile from Foresthill Road.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">More information is available at Birding Hotspots of Placer County (geocities.com/placerbird/placercobirding) by Bruce Webb. &nbsp;Another good resource is </span><span class="c1 c4">The American River: &nbsp;a Recreational Guide Book</span><span class="c1">, published by Protect American River Canyons (PARC).</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Chris Conard</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span></span></p></body></html>
